# PyDAProject
This project is to implement a digital assistant named PyDA. PyDA will find answer for user queries using
Wolfram Alpha computational enginer and Wikipedia page articles.
PyDA returns the answer in both text and speech format. The speech format is implemented using pyttsx3 library.
Right now, the voice can be female/male. In future version, I plan to develop PyDA with voice being user choice
including a non-binary gender neutral voice.

Developed based out of introduction in Udemy Free Python Tutorial by Adam Eubanks for Python 2 version.
Updated the digital assistant PyDA with libraries for Python 3 version; 
I have adapted to mediawiki library instead of wikipedia library available for python.
I have also added more function using Wolframalpha library to search for the query and handle error gracefully.
